# House Property Sales Analysis

## Overview  
The retail industry increasingly relies on data analytics tools to estimate property prices accurately. This project analyzes house property sales in an Australian city using SQL and data exploration techniques.

## Dataset  
The **House Property Sales** dataset on Kaggle contains the file `raw_sales.csv` with the following variables:  

| Column    | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Datesold` | Date when the property was sold |
| `Postcode` | 4-digit postcode of the suburb |
| `Price`    | Sale price of the property |
| `Bedrooms` | Number of bedrooms |

## Project Goals  
1. Perform initial SQL exploration to understand the dataset scale.  
2. Answer key analytical questions to uncover sales patterns.  

### Key Questions  
1. **Which date had the highest number of sales?**  
2. **Which postcode has the highest average sale price?** *(Use aggregate functions)*  
3. **Which year had the lowest number of sales?**  
4. **Deduce the top 6 postcodes by annual price using window functions.**
