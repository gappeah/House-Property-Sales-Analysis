# House Price Analysis in the UK Housing Market with Machine Learning and NLP

This project aims to analyze the UK housing market by combining machine learning for price prediction with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract insights from textual data.

## Project Goal

- Develop a model to predict house prices considering traditional features and textual descriptions.
- Gain a deeper understanding of factors influencing house prices in the UK market through NLP analysis.

## Data

### Primary Data
- Utilize a publicly available house price dataset from Kaggle or government open data portals (same as original project).

### Secondary Data
- Web scraped property listings from real estate websites or online marketplaces.

## Methodology

### Data Acquisition and Exploration
- Download house price dataset and scrape property listings.
- Explore both datasets to understand features, data types, and identify missing values or outliers.

### Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values in both datasets through imputation or removal.
- Encode categorical features (e.g., one-hot encoding).
- Feature scaling or normalization might be necessary (numerical data).

### Feature Engineering
- Create new features from existing ones in the house price dataset (e.g., total living area).
- Apply NLP techniques to extract features from property listing descriptions. This could involve:
  - Identifying named entities (locations, amenities)
  - Sentiment analysis to understand the overall tone of the description (positive, negative)
  - Topic modeling to identify recurring themes (e.g., "family-friendly," "luxury living")

### Model Building and Training
- Train machine learning models on the prepared house price dataset, incorporating the newly created features.
- Consider models like:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regression
  - Gradient Boosting Regression
- Hyperparameter tuning will be performed to optimize model performance.

### Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the trained models on a separate testing set.
- Use metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the accuracy of price predictions.
- Analyze the impact of NLP-derived features on model performance.

### Deployment (Optional)
- Deploy the final model as a web service or integrate it into an application for house price prediction.
- This could allow users to input property details and descriptions for a more comprehensive analysis.
