# House Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This project explores using machine learning algorithms to predict house prices.

## Project Goal

The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the selling price of a house based on various features that influence its value.

## Data

- We will utilize a publicly available house price dataset. Popular sources include Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/) or government open data portals.
- The dataset should contain various features that might influence house price, such as:
 - Location (city, neighborhood)
 - Property characteristics (square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, garage)
 - Amenities (pool, fireplace)
 - Age of the house
 - Lot size
- Data exploration and cleaning will be crucial steps to ensure the model's accuracy.

## Methodology

1. **Data Acquisition and Exploration:**
  - Download a house price dataset.
  - Explore the data to understand the features, data types, and identify any missing values or outliers.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handle missing values through imputation or removal.
  - Encode categorical features (e.g., one-hot encoding).
  - Feature scaling or normalization might be necessary.
  - Feature engineering might be employed to create new features from existing ones (e.g., total living area).

3. **Model Building and Training:**
  - Train different machine learning models on the prepared data. Common choices for house price prediction include:
    - Linear Regression
    - Random Forest Regression
    - Gradient Boosting Regression
  - Hyperparameter tuning will be performed to optimize the model's performance.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
  - The trained models will be evaluated on a separate testing set.
  - Metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) will be used to assess the accuracy of the predictions.
  - Model selection will be based on the model with the lowest RMSE.

5. **Deployment (Optional):**
  - Depending on the project's goals, the final model can be deployed as a web service or integrated into an application to allow users to predict house prices based on new property data.

## Tools and Libraries

- Programming Language (Python is popular for machine learning)
- Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Data Analysis Libraries (e.g., pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization Libraries (e.g., matplotlib, seaborn)

## Disclaimer

It's important to note that this is a simplified overview. The specific steps and tools might vary depending on the chosen dataset and desired model complexity.

## Next Steps

- Identify a specific house price dataset.
- Choose the machine learning models to experiment with.
- Start with data exploration and preprocessing.

This project provides a starting point for exploring machine learning applications in real estate. By following these steps and adapting them to your chosen dataset and chosen models, you can build your own house price prediction model.
